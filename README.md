Encrypted negative password authentication.

Traditional Text-Based password authentication systems face persistent challenges such as password leaks, brute-force attacks, and the vulnerabilities associated with weak or reused passwords. Text-based passwords are still the most popular and widely used authentication technique, despite its security flaws related to password storage. To address these issues, there is a need for innovative authentication methods that enhance security while also maintain usability.
The proposed framework includes two phases: the registration phase and authentication phase. When adopting our framework to protect passwords in an authentication data table, the system designer must first select a cryptographic hash function and a symmetric-key algorithm, where the condition that must be satisfied is that the size of the hash value of the selected cryptographic hash function is equal to the key size of the selected symmetric-key algorithm. The ENP is the first password protection scheme that combines the cryptographic hash function, the negative password and the symmetric-key algorithm, without the need for additional information except the plain password ensuring robust security and usability.
